# twc-test-api

This is the Back-end of the application which has been built using Node.js.

-Express.js has been used to implement the REST API
-MonoDB has been used as the database asset.

## Note
Backend for this project was implemented some months after the implementation of the Frontend. This was due to my lack of knowledge about the backend development, At the time I was building the front-end. Now I have comparatively higher experience and knwoledge in backend development and I eager to learn more.

## How to run the application

2.Install the node modules.

3.The .env file including the MONGO_URI which contains sensitive information has not included in this public repo. 

4.Run the application after connecting with a mongoDB collection.
